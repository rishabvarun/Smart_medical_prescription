smart health card. The system includes 3 types of users patient, physician and pharmacist. The system stores the patients health details
(which can be updated only by a doctor) and also his past prescriptions (which can be added only by a doctor). When the doctor initially
adds a prescription the checked status of the presctiprion is false and later when the medicine is given by the pharmacist (after he opens
